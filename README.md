## Task 1
#### Posters and Fliers
Digital posters and flyers have to be visually appealing while
satisfactorily communicating a message to the public.
Creating posters and fliers for public relations and
marketing campaigns will expose you to scaling and proper
design layouts in digital platforms.
## Task 2
#### Logos
Logos are a representation of what a brand or organization
stands for. They speak volumes about what companies do
and subtly express their values. Professionals often follow
the Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) approach while designing
logos, focusing on minimalism and the business’ core values.
This fundamental principle is suggestive of the power of
simplicity in graphic design.
## Task 3
#### Business Card
This design challenge will allow you to practice the skills
mentioned above. Every business relies on business cards as
a means of introduction. They are also an expression of the
company’s branding. Therefore, it is vital to capture the
company’s essence through excellent typography and some
ingenuity.
## Task 4
#### Infographics
Infographics employ pictures, data visualizations,
typography, and statistical graphics to tell a straightforward
story or present information. Working on an infographic will
give you experience with important tools like Canva and
Venngage and allow you to exercise your creativity as you
think of ways to represent information in a way that is
visually attractive, impactful, and effective.
